# Vision Systems Lab: Learning Computer Vision on GPUs
Repository of the CudaVision Lab at University of Bonn (SS19) implemented (mostly) on Pytorch, Python3 and Jupyter notebooks. The following projects are contained in the respective folders:

### Project 1: Softmax Regression (without autograd/Pytorch Tensors)
Involves using softmax regression for classifying the MNIST dataset.

### Project 2: Multilayer Neural Network
Involves training simple multilayer neural networks with k-fold cross validation for hyperparameter search. Classification was done on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
